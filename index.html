                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Not long ago, I aspired to be an architect due to my passion for design and creativity. However, I later discovered my interest in software and became proficient in tools like Blender, AutoCAD, and SketchUp. Surprisingly, I ended up studying computer science at UWI. The world of computer science offered endless possibilities, and now I can learn and build to my heart's content. This is my journey into the world of technology. Peace!</p>
